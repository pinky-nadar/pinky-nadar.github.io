                <h2 class="mt-0">Contract Management App</h2>
                <p class="color2">Our app simplifies contract management by creating a centralized repository for contracts and using OCR to extract obligations and clauses.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p class="color2">Organizations struggle with managing contracts efficiently due to reliance on paper-based methods. This manual process often leads to inefficiencies, such as difficulty in locating specific contracts, time-consuming search processes, and challenges in tracking contract status and obligations.</p>
                <p class="color2">The transition to a digital contract management solution is necessary to eliminate these inefficiencies and improve overall contract management processes.</p>
                
                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p class="color2">Create a user-friendly digital contract management system that streamlines storage, improves search functionality, and provides clear visibility into contract status and obligations, ultimately enhancing productivity and efficiency.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Core Features</h3>
